## Code Description
The code for the WH Price Wave Pattern MT4 indicator is written in MQL5 language. It consists of several sections, each serving a specific purpose. The main sections of the code are as follows:

### Input Parameters
The code begins by defining the input parameters for the indicator. These parameters include the period for calculating price waves and the deviation threshold for identifying price waves. Traders can modify these parameters according to their preferences.

### Global Variables
Next, the code defines global variables that are used to store the high and low points of price waves, as well as a counter for the number of identified price waves. These variables are used throughout the indicator to track and analyze price movements.

### Custom Indicator Initialization Function
The OnInit() function is the initialization function for the custom indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers, styles, and labels. In this code, two buffers are used to store the high and low points of price waves. The indicator labels are set to 'Wave High' and 'Wave Low' for the respective buffers.

### Custom Indicator Iteration Function
The OnCalculate() function is the main iteration function for the custom indicator. It is called for each new tick or bar in the chart data. In this function, the code identifies price waves by comparing the current high and low values with the highest high and lowest low values within the specified period. If a potential high or low is identified, it is stored in the respective buffer and the wave count is incremented.

### Custom Trading Function
The OnTick() function is the trading function for the custom indicator. It is called on each new tick and can be used to make trading decisions based on the identified price waves. In this code, the function predicts the market movement based on the last identified wave. If the last wave was a high, it predicts an upward trend. If the last wave was a low, it predicts a downward trend.

### Expert Deinitialization Function
The OnDeinit() function is the deinitialization function for the custom indicator. It is called when the indicator is removed or the chart is closed. In this code, the function resets the global variables to their initial values.
